Background 
-----------------------------------------
Approximate hours spent: 20
The main reference that I used to create a running theme for the site was the work I did for my software engineering module, the team logo. I thought the red, grey and white theme would suit my online portfolio. It would look professional and still maintain the ascetics from the logo that I wanted to keep. 
Other reference regarding themes and site structure are listed below:
1.	https://joel.sh
2.	http://www.luiskonrad.com
3.	http://www.mynus.sk
reference one confirmed my belief that the colour scheme would look attractive yet professional. Reference two indicated that I would need an eye-catching homepage to attract potential employers, possibly simple homepage design and catchy title. Lastly reference three had an intricate grid system that I wanted to implement in my site as opposed to normal tables containing data.



Design
----------------------
To begin with I sketched a few ideas on a piece of paper just to get an idea of how I wanted the site to roughly look in both desktop and mobile variations, bellow is the cleaned up final sketch
 
As seen there will be four pages, the homepage, my cv, my bio and contact me. These pages will be discussed further bellow.
homepage
 
As stated in the references I wanted to make the home page as simple as possible, to draw the users attention to the centre of the screen, thus my name and the learn more button. Starting from the top we have the navigation bar, this will be a simple four button flexbox row but when in mobile mode it will turn in to a column for easier navigation on smaller screens. The titles themselves will have animations that will allow them to slide in from the left. The background will be an image I have taken in the past that represents myself and if possible will also be the same theme colour as the site. Lastly the footer will be a bar with all of my social media and GitHub/ CodePen links. If a user wants to contact me through them they are free to do so.
Contact me

 
The contact me page will be of a similar style to the homepage. The header will contain an animated heading at the top centre of the page and a scrolling image in the background. Bellow that there will be the same navigation bar as the homepage with flex properties to allow it to still be functional on smaller screens. The contents of the page itself will be a basic form with some instructions for use. It will have name, email and message text fields as well as a submit button. The footer will again have the same contact links as the home page.
My bio

 
The bio page will follow the same style as the contact page. The contents will be split in two. The about me side will just have personal information about me and what I do outside programing and the gallery section will have images from my travels or experiences. If possible I will attempt to get the gallery to be interactive in some way (zoomable images).

My CV
Lastly the cv page will have data from my actual CV, these will be grades, work experience and programing skills. It will also contain the university modules I am taking as a computing student. The grades will be contained within simple tables, however the university modules and skills sections will have custom built grid system that will looks similar to the tables ascetically. These grids will of course be flex boxed so they can adapt to when someone views the page on mobile.



Test mock-up
finally, here is a mock-up done in Photoshop for how the basic homage would look. I think the red colour scheme is suitable here.
 

 
Weekly progress

Evaluation 
--------------------------
I believe the project has gone according to plan and that the end product is a fully functioning site. 

The positives include:
•	A functional gallery system. 
•	My own table/ grid system
•	Aesthetic scrolling headers and animated headings.
•	Nicely skinned forms and overlay a good looking site.

Improvements include:
•	The grid system could use some work to look more dynamic.
•	The footer could use improvement to stop it from sliding up the page when there is no content there.
